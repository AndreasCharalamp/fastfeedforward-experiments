# Load Balance and Master Leaf on Fast Feedforward Networks
A repository for the experiments conducted in link.
We reproduce experiments from ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14711)) and present results on FFF models enhanced using ideas inspired by Mixture of Experts(MoE) reasearch.

More information can be found in the paper "Enhancing Fast Feed Forward Networks with Load Balancing and a Master Leaf Node" ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16836)).

## Index
1. In the Experiments reproduction folder there is the code needed to test the Load Balance and Master Leaf on FFFs yourself.
2. In the models folder there are the parameters of the models we trained for the experiments presented in link. 
The best models for each parameter couple (w,l) are separately put in /models/{METHOD}/{DATASET}/best directory
